    <h1>ok... hi wassup. I used to do html on like some online learning website so long ago this is nostalgic</h1>
    <p>I used to have a gaming channel but I have always loved making games even back to like... ScRaTcH</a>.</p>
    <p>A while ago, I was watching Dani and was like... shoot... I should try making a game. Now like a year into learning game development, I've learned so much.</p>
    <p>At first, i was gonna make a mascot horror game then realised I needed to learn more C# and Unity skills than I already had, which mostly consisted of tutorials</p>
    <p>If I were to change something, I would have tried learning earlier and more learning code than just Unity because a lot of my learning was about how to use Unity</p>
    <p>though I could definately write code, I could barely understand c#, which is not good for a dev... well here I am. Downloading my Unity project from one comp</p>
    <p>to another... remembering how to write HTML. Well subscribe to my youtube channel and look at my game when its out... someone who probably isn't reading this cause... why.</p>
